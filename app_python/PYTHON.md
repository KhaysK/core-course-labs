## Best Practices

1. **Modularity**: The code is well-organized into distinct functions. The `show_time` function handles the logic for the '/' route, promoting code maintainability and readability.

2. **Dependency Management**: The code imports only the necessary libraries (Flask, datetime, pytz) and avoids including any unused imports.

3. **Route Definition**: Flask's `@app.route('/')` decorator is effectively used to define the route for the root URL ('/'). This follows Flask's recommended route definition pattern.

## Framework Choice

### Flask

Flask is a lightweight, beginner-friendly, and flexible web framework. It's an excellent choice for small to medium-sized applications, especially for those who are new to web development due to its simplicity. Flask allows developers the freedom to choose their components and libraries, making it easy to start. However, for larger and more complex projects, Flask might require more effort to scale and may lack certain built-in features that larger frameworks offer.

## Linters

Linters play a crucial role in maintaining code quality and consistency. In this project, we used the following linters:

- Python: Flake8
- Markdown: markdownlint
